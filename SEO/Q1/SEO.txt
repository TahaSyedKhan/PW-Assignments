SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the practice of optimizing a website or online content to improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). 

Increased Visibility: SEO helps your website appear higher in search results when people search for keywords related to your content or business. When your site ranks well, more people are likely to see and click on it.

Credibility and Trust: Websites that appear at the top of search results are often perceived as more credible and trustworthy by users.

Better User Experience: Part of SEO involves optimizing the structure and content of your website. This can lead to a better user experience, faster loading times, and mobile-friendliness, all of which contribute to higher user satisfaction.
