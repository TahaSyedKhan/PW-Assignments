In the context of web development, "web accessibility" refers to the practice of ensuring that websites and web applications are usable by people with disabilities. This involves making web content and functionality accessible to a wide range of users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. 

 Here's why it's essential to create accessible websites and how it benefits different user groups:

Legal Requirements: Many countries have laws and regulations that require websites to be accessible.

Inclusivity: Accessible websites ensure that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access and use the information and services provided

Improved User Experience: Web accessibility features, such as proper semantic HTML, alternative text for images, and keyboard navigation, not only benefit users with disabilities but also enhance the overall user experience for all visitors.
